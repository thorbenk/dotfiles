# Vim

Currently using some Alt-Shortcuts, which don't work within terminal
emulators, but only in gvim.

- Jump to previous: `C-o` ("old")

## Window Management

- Navigate around windows `A-{hjkl}`
- Resize windows with `A-S-{hjkl}`

## CtrlP

- ask which split to use `C-o` 

## NerdTree

- Open/close the tree `A-0`
- With a file selected in the tree, open it
  in horizontal split `i`, vertical split `s`,

## Navigation

- Jump back/forward `C-o`, `C-i`

## Folds

- Open/close `zo`, `zc` (`z` is a folded piece of paper)
- Close all `zm` ("fold more": decrease foldlevel)

## Rust

- `F1` runs `cargo build` in the background
- Quickfix window opens if errors occured  
  `:Copen` to manually open (e.g. to look at warnings)
- `:cf` jumps to first error, `:cn` to next

- `gd` goes to definition
